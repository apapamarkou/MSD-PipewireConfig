# MSD-PipewireConfig

This is a linux QT Gui application made with Gambas3.

Since I couldn't find any GUI anywhere to help me change pipewire settings quickly and easily, 
I decided to use Gambas3 and make my own. Gambas3 is an amazing tool to design easily small 
applications in no time.

This application during its operation does not touch/change any settings file locally or globally 
in the system. It simply executes commands that forces pipewire to change sample-rate and buffer size.

I hope it will be useful to others.

I hope to find time to develop it further.

Check the /binary folder for ready-made installation packages.
